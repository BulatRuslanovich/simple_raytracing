# Simple Raytracing

This project is a basic implementation of ray tracing in C. It demonstrates the fundamental concepts of ray tracing, such as ray-sphere intersection, shading, and rendering.

## Features

- Ray-sphere intersection
- Basic shading

## Demonstration
Here is a GIF demonstrating the output of the ray tracing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- SDL2 Library

### Building

To build the project, run the following command:

```sh
cd simple_raytracing
gcc raytracing.c -o raytracing -lm -lSDL2
./raytracing
```
